[Wondering why I built Forge?](motivation.md)

Forge currently exposes running [GitHub Actions](github-actions.md) (e.g. [`actions/setup-go`](https://github.com/actions/setup-go)), [Concourse resources](concourse.md) (e.g. `concourse/git-resource`) and [Google Cloudbuild steps](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/create-basic-configuration) (e.g. [`gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker`](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/building/build-containers)) _and more_ in its [Go module](library.md).
